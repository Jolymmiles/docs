## Subscription Lifecycle

4. Completes payment
5. Receives configuration

## Trial System Configuration

### Enable Trials

```bash
TRIAL_DAYS=7
TRIAL_TRAFFIC_LIMIT=10
TRIAL_REMNAWAVE_TAG=trial_user
```

### How It Works

1. **New User**: Automatically offered trial
2. **Trial Period**: 7 days (configurable)
3. **Traffic Limit**: 10GB (configurable)
4. **Tracking**: Separate tag in Remnawave

### Trial Squad Configuration (Trial Period)

Trials can use different squads:

```bash
TRIAL_INTERNAL_SQUADS=abc12345-def6-7890-ghij-klmnopqrstuv
TRIAL_EXTERNAL_SQUAD_UUID=xyz98765-abc4-3210-defg-hijklmnopqrs
```

## Traffic Limits

Control bandwidth usage:

```bash
TRAFFIC_LIMIT=100          # Regular users: 100GB
TRIAL_TRAFFIC_LIMIT=10     # Trial users: 10GB
```

- **0** = Unlimited traffic
- Units in **GB**
- Monitored per subscription
- Enforced by panel

## Subscription States

```
Active → (24h before) → About to Expire → Expired
  ↓
  └→ Renewal → Active
```

Users can:
- ✅ View subscription status anytime
- ✅ Renew if needed
- ✅ Switch payment methods

## Troubleshooting

**User not receiving reminder**
- Check system time (16:00 UTC)
- Verify Telegram token is active
- Check user language preference

**Trial not activating**
- Verify `TRIAL_DAYS > 0`
- Check Remnawave connectivity
- Review logs for errors

**Can't renew subscription**
- Ensure payment method is enabled
- Verify user has no balance issues
- Check Remnawave panel connectivity
