description: Configure squad assignment for users and trials

## What are Squads?

Squads represent groups in Remnawave. You can selectively assign which squads users get access to.

## Internal Squad Configuration

```bash
SQUAD_UUIDS=773db654-a8b2-413a-a50b-75c3536238fd,bc979bdd-f1fa-4d94-8a51-38a0f518a2a2
```

- Configure comma-separated squad UUIDs
- Only matching squads are assigned to users
- If empty, all available squads are assigned

## External Squad Configuration

```bash
EXTERNAL_SQUAD_UUID=773db654-a8b2-413a-a50b-75c3536238fd
```

- Single external squad UUID
- Included in all user creation/update requests
- Leave empty to disable

## Trial Squad Configuration

Separate squads can be assigned to trial users:

```bash
TRIAL_INTERNAL_SQUADS=773db654-a8b2-413a-a50b-75c3536238fd,bc979bdd-f1fa-4d94-8a51-38a0f518a2a2
TRIAL_EXTERNAL_SQUAD_UUID=773db654-a8b2-413a-a50b-75c3536238fd
```

### Behavior

- **If set**: Trial users are assigned to trial-specific squads
- **If not set**: Trial users use regular squad configuration (fallback behavior)
- **Use case**: Isolate trial traffic to prevent resource exhaustion

## Example Configuration

```bash
# Regular users get access to multiple squads
SQUAD_UUIDS=773db654-a8b2-413a-a50b-75c3536238fd,bc979bdd-f1fa-4d94-8a51-38a0f518a2a2
EXTERNAL_SQUAD_UUID=773db654-a8b2-413a-a50b-75c3536238fd

# Trial users get separate trial squads
TRIAL_INTERNAL_SQUADS=abc12345-def6-7890-ghij-klmnopqrstuv
TRIAL_EXTERNAL_SQUAD_UUID=xyz98765-abc4-3210-defg-hijklmnopqrs
```
2. **Use external squads** for load distribution
3. **Document squad purposes** with meaningful naming
4. **Test squad assignment** with test users first
5. **Monitor squad usage** in Remnawave panel
